# Setup

## Tips

* Make sure the folder "envman" is located in the home path (Type `echo $HOME` if you have no knowledge of what the home directory is)

* You might need to create a folder called "envs" in the directory "envman"

* Make a copy of the __envman__ script into a folder in your system path (a common one is /usr/bin)

# Running envman

* Once a copy of envman is accessible in your system path, run envman like this:

    - `source envman <add arguments here>`
    - OR: `.envmav <add arguments here>` (Make sure you add the "." before calling envman)
